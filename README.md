# ChoreWheel-Landru
A modern day chore wheel - randomly dividing a chore list up and emailing you.

This randomly splits a list of chores in two, and emails you from "Landru," the machine overlord from Star Trek's "The Return of the Archons".

---

Uses perl, Email::Sender, and Email::Stuffer.

(My initial goal was to simply type 'Landru' in the terminal to email us our weekly chores.)
