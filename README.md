# ChoreWheel-Landru
A modern day chore wheel - randomly dividing a chore list up and emailing you.

This randomly splits a list of chores in two, and emails you from "Landru," the machine overlord from Star Trek's "The Return of the Archons".

---

Uses perl and the Mail::Sender library, available in CPAN.

The .pl files are used by the main executable Landru.
After editing the chore-list in chores.pl and the email address info in mailer.pl, simply run the perl script Landru.

(My initial goal was to simply type 'Landru' in the terminal to email us our weekly chores.)
